--For each employee who represents customers, output the total # of orders
--that employeeâ€™s customers have placed alongside the total sale amount of those orders.
--* The employee name should be output as a single column named `Sales Rep` formatted
 --as `lastName, firstName`.
--* The second column should be titled `# Orders` and the third should be `Total Sales`.
--* Sort the output by `Total Sales` descending.
--* Only (and all) employees with the job title `Sales Rep` should be included in the output, 
--and if the employee made no sales the `Total Sales` should display as `0.00`.
